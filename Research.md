During my professional experience with enterprise-level automated vehicle projects, I specialized in multidimensional data analysis. This involved not only extracting and processing large datasets from real vehicles but also integrating and analyzing eye-tracking data of drivers. Such comprehensive data handling equipped me with a unique perspective on human-machine interaction, specifically in understanding and optimizing takeover behavior in autonomous driving.

### Jun 2018 – May 2019  "Intelligent Robots——Combat Robot "<br>

> ### Overview <br>
>
> <font color='red'>Program designer</font> <br>As a member of the intelligent robot project team (only 3 candidates), I was fully involved in the development of a sophisticated combat robot named "Pioneer." As the chief software architect of this project, I spearheaded the entire programming and functional implementation of the robot, with a particular emphasis on the development of its core logic: autonomous patrolling, enemy detection and attack strategies, and evasion and disguise mechanisms. Ultimately, we fabricated two prototypes of "Pioneer" and participated in the finals of the Intelligent Robotics Competition.

> ### My Contributions
> 1. Architected the software system and hardware-software integration for Pioneer based on key competition requirements like the arena dimensions, weight limits, and scoring mechanics. This involved close collaboration with the mechanical and electrical engineers in the team.
> 2. Created autonomous control algorithms enabling Pioneer to intelligently navigate around the arena without falling off, using data from infrared and analog sensors. The algorithms had to be robust to sensor noise and uncertainties.  
> 3. Developed opponent search-and-attack logic by fusing inputs from multiple infrared rangefinders to reliably detect and lock on to enemy robots. This included aiming routines to align our robot's shovel perfectly for maximum pushing power.  
> 4. Optimized the software for real-time performance and responsiveness during battles. This was challenging due to the complex state transitions required between exploration, attack, and self-preservation modes.
> 5. Led the strategy for integrating and testing the complete robotic system. Coordinated with team members to troubleshoot issues like PCB failures or mechanical alignment problems.

> ### Outcome
>
> In the competition, "Pioneer" excelled, reliably exploring over 90% of the arena and defeating two opposing robots with coordinated attack logic using just one unit. Our emerging team stood out amidst fierce competition from seasoned teams nationwide, reaffirming the efficacy of the software system I developed for "Pioneer." This project enhanced my skills in robot algorithms, software architecture, hardware-software integration, and leading engineering teams.
