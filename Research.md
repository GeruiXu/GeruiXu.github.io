During my professional experience with enterprise-level automated vehicle projects, I specialized in multidimensional data analysis. This involved not only extracting and processing large datasets from real vehicles but also integrating and analyzing eye-tracking data of drivers. Such comprehensive data handling equipped me with a unique perspective on human-machine interaction, specifically in understanding and optimizing takeover behavior in autonomous driving.

> ### Overview: Pioneer
>
> As part of a university team (3 candidates), I participated in the development of an autonomous robot named "Pioneer" for the Intelligent Robotics Competition finals. As the lead programmer, I spearheaded the software system design and implementation, especially the core functionalities of autonomous exploration and opponent search-and-attack.

> ### My Contributions
> 1. Architected the software system and hardware-software integration for Pioneer based on key competition requirements like the arena dimensions, weight limits, and scoring mechanics. This involved close collaboration with the mechanical and electrical engineers in the team.
>
> 2. Created autonomous control algorithms enabling Pioneer to intelligently navigate around the arena without falling off, using data from infrared and analog sensors. The algorithms had to be robust to sensor noise and uncertainties.  
>
> 3. Developed opponent search-and-attack logic by fusing inputs from multiple infrared rangefinders to reliably detect and lock on to enemy robots. This included aiming routines to align our robot's shovel perfectly for maximum pushing power.  
>
> 4. Optimized the software for real-time performance and responsiveness during battles. This was challenging due to the complex state transitions required between exploration, attack, and self-preservation modes.
>
> 5. Led the strategy for integrating and testing the complete robotic system. Coordinated with team members to troubleshoot issues like PCB failures or mechanical alignment problems.  
>
> ### Outcome
> Pioneer performed admirably in competition trials, reliably exploring over 90% of the arena and defeating opponent robots through coordinated attacks. Our team finished as quarter-finalists amidst tough competition from veteran teams, proving the effectiveness of Pioneer's software systems that I created. This project enhanced my skills in robotics algorithms, software architectures, hardware-software integration, and leading engineering teams.
