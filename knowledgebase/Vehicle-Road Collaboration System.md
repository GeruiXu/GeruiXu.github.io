## Vehicle-Road Collaboration System

#d Vehicle-Road Collaboration
Vehicle-Road Collaboration refers to the concept of vehicles and road infrastructure working together to improve traffic efficiency, safety, and sustainability. It is a part of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and aims to connect vehicles, roads, and smart devices to create seamless interaction between vehicles and infrastructure. This collaboration provides drivers with real-time traffic and road condition information, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of traffic.

#d Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication
A key technology in vehicle-road collaboration is Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. This enables vehicles to communicate with surrounding infrastructure, such as traffic lights, road sensors, and other vehicles, to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety.

#e Traffic Congestion
For instance, V2I can offer real-time traffic information sharing that goes beyond individual vehicles, helping to avoid congestion and providing alternative route options.

#e Traffic Light Planning
More specifically, in time-sensitive tasks performed by vehicles, traffic light planning involves coordinating with traffic lights at intersections to devise the best approach for crossing. This includes decisions on whether to accelerate to beat a light turning red in the last few seconds, as well as long-distance planning of vehicle speed across multiple traffic lights to minimize waiting times.

#d Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication
Another important technology is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, which allows vehicles to communicate with each other, sharing information about road conditions, traffic, and potential hazards. V2V can help prevent accidents and improve traffic flow, as vehicles can adjust their speed and route based on real-time information from other vehicles, forming a hive-like collaborative decision-making process among multiple vehicles.

#e Intent Sharing
For example, if a vehicle in the rear intends to speed up or change lanes, this intention can be communicated to vehicles ahead, allowing the fleet to adjust its speed and vehicle spacing. This reduces inter-vehicle conflicts and prevents congestion due to sudden events in the convoy.
