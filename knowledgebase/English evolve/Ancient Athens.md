**TPO40-1 ****Ancient Athens**

 **雅典的背景**  

One of the most important changes in Greece during the period from 800 B.C. to 500 B.C. was the rise of the polis(古希腊的城邦), or city-state(城邦), and <span style='color:#c00000'>each polis</span> developed a system of government that was <span style='color:#c00000'>appropriate to its circumstances</span>. The problems that were faced and solved in Athens(雅典（希腊首都）) were the sharing of political power between the established aristocracy and the emerging other classes, and the adjustment of aristocratic ways of life to the ways of life of the new polis. It was the harmonious <span style='color:#c00000'>blending of all of these elements</span> that was to <span style='color:#c00000'>produce</span> the <span style='color:#c00000'>classical culture of Athens</span>.

**雅典民主兴起的影响**

   Entering the polis age, Athens had the traditional institutions of <span style='color:#c00000'>other</span> Greek protodemocratic states: an assembly of adult males, an aristocratic council, and annually elected officials. Within this traditional framework the Athenians, between 600 B.C. and 450 B. C., evolved what Greeks regarded as a <span style='color:#c00000'>fully fledged democratic constitution</span>, though the right to vote was given to <span style='color:#c00000'>fewer groups</span> of people than is seen in modem times.

**削弱贵族的进程**

   The first steps toward change were taken by Solon(梭伦,雅典立法家) in 594 B. C.，when he broke the aristocracy's stranglehold on elected offices by establishing wealth rather than birth as the basis of office holding, (列举削弱贵族的措施)<span style='color:#c00000'>abolishing the economic obligations</span> of ordinary Athenians to the aristocracy, and allowing the <span style='color:#c00000'>assembly</span> (of which all citizens were equal members) to <span style='color:#c00000'>overrule the decisions</span> of local courts in certain cases. (进一步削弱)The strength of the Athenian aristocracy was further weakened during the rest of the century by the rise of a type of government known as a tyranny, which is a form of interim rule by a popular strongman (**not rule** by a ruthless dictator **as the modern use** of the term suggests to us). The Peisistratids, as the succession of tyrants were called (after the founder of the dynasty, Peisistratos), strengthened Athenian central administration at the expense of the aristocracy by <span style='color:#c00000'>appointing judges</span> throughout the region, producing Athens’ first <span style='color:#c00000'>national coinage</span>, and adding and embellishing <span style='color:#c00000'>festivals</span> that tended to focus attention on <span style='color:#c00000'>Athens</span> rather than on local villages of the surrounding region.（继任者继续削弱的三措施） By the end of the century, the time was <span style='color:#c00000'>**ripe**</span> for more change: the tyrants were driven out, and in 508 B C a new reformer, Cleisthenes(克里斯提尼, 雅典政治家), <span style='color:#c00000'>**gave final form**</span> to the developments reducing aristocratic control already under way. 

**新民主政体构成**

   Cleisthenes' principal contribution to the creation of democracy at Athens was to <span style='color:#c00000'>complete </span>the long process of<span style='color:#c00000'> weakening family and clan structures</span>, especially among the aristocrats, and to set in their place locality-based corporations called demes, which became the point of entry for all civic and most religious life in Athens. Out of the demes were created 10 artificial tribes of roughly equal population. From the demes, by either election or selection, came 500 members of a new council, 6,000 jurors for the courts, 10 generals, and hundreds of commissioners. The assembly was sovereign in all matters but in practice <span style='color:#c00000'>delegated its power</span> to subordinate bodies such as the council, which prepared the agenda for the meetings of the assembly, and me courts, which took care of most judicial matters. Various committees acted as an executive branch, implementing policies of the assembly and supervising, for instance, the food and water supplies and public buildings. This wide-scale participation by the citizenry in the government distinguished the democratic form of the Athenian polis from other, less liberal forms.

**克利斯提尼的改革****的影响**

   The effect of Cleisthenes’ reforms was to establish the superiority of the Athenian community as a whole over local institutions without destroying them. National politics rather than local or deme politics became the focal point. At the same time, entry into national politics began at the deme level and gave local loyalty a new focus: Athens itself. Over the next two centuries the implications of Cleisthenes’ reforms were fully exploited.

**雅典民主的历史评价**

   During the fifth century B. C. the council of 500 was extremely influential in shaping policy. In the next century, however, it was the mature assembly that took on decision-making responsibility. By any measure other than that of the aristocrats (不管以什么标准来衡量，除了贵族阶层), who had been upstaged by the supposedly inferior "people," the Athenian democracy was a stunning success. Never before, or since, have so many people been involved in the serious business of self-governance. It was precisely this opportunity to participate in public life that provided a stimulus for the brilliant unfolding of classical Greek culture.

**题目分析**

**paragraph 1**

   One of the most important changes in Greece during the period from 800 B.C. to 500 B.C. was the rise of the polis, or city-state, and each polis developed a system of government that was appropriate to its circumstances. The problems that were faced and solved in Athens were the sharing of political power between the established aristocracy and the emerging other classes, and the adjustment of aristocratic ways of life to the ways of life of the new polis. It was the      harmonious blending of all of these elements that was to produce the classical culture of Athens.
