> To meet growing international demand for energy,scientists and politicians are looking beyond the traditional energy sources of oil and coal to other less developed technologies. One such technology is nuclear power,which uses radioactive fuels such as uranium to generate energy. Although some people believe that nuclear power plants should be built on a large scale to supply some of the world's energy needs,critics argue that nuclear power is unsafe and too costly. In addition,there are better alterative technologies.
>
> First,nuclear power plants present safety concerns. Radioactive materials that are used to generate energy in nuclear reactors (where the energy-generating reactions take place)pose a potential threat to human health. The risk of radioactive material escaping from the reactor into the environment increases greatly if the core of a reactor overheats. The public is uneasy about the safeguards presently in place to prevent reactors from becoming too hot.
>
> Second,it is more expensive to build nuclear power plants than other types of plants. The construction of a typical nuclear power plant costs at least $2 billion and can be up to $5 billion. Nuclear plants are so much more expensive than conventional coal and oil plants because the specialized safety equipment they currently use to safeguard against accidents is expensive,and they may become still more expensive in the future if the public continues to demand even greater safety.
>
> Third. there are other technologies that are better and cheaper than nuclear power. Wind turbines. for instance, are completely safe and. according to recent analyses, cost less than nuclear power. Further, turbines run on a renewable source of energy (wind), so their energy source will never be depleted.
